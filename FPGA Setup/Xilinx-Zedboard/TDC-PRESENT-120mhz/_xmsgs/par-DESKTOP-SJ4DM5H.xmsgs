Extra Effort Level &quot;c&quot;ontinue is not a runtime optimized effort level. It is intended to be used for designs that are not meeting timing but where the designer wants the tools to continue iterating on the design until no further design speed improvements are possible.  This can result in very long runtimes since the tools will continue improving the design even if the time specs can not be met. If you are looking for the best possible design speed available from a long but reasonable runtime use Extra Effort Level &quot;n&quot;ormal.  It will stop iterating on the design when the design speed improvements have shrunk to the point that the time specs are not expected to be met.

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.
